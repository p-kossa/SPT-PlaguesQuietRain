A BepInEx mod that lets you change the volume of the rain, thunder and wind!

## ðŸ“– What is this mod?

This is a client-side mod made for [BepInEx][bepinex] that allows users to change the volume of rain, thunder and other outdoors ambience sounds in SPTarkov.

Were you ever irritated by how loud rain can be in SPTarkov?
This mod allows you to adjust the audio level of rain to your liking (to some degree).

## âœ… Features

- Adjust the audio volume of rain, thunder and other outdoors ambience sounds between 0 and 1 to save your ears.
 - Unfortunately, if you are a psychopath and want even louder noises, you can not make that happen as it's default value is already as loud as it can go.
 - It is not possible to set the wind volume separately from other ambient sound effects such as bird chirping/cricket noises.

## ðŸ“– Usage

Using this mod is very simple!

Put the `.dll` file in your `BepInEx/plugins` folder and you are good to go!

To access the options of the mod within the game, you have to press `F12` key in game to bring up the Configuration Manager UI.

## ðŸ“– Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with every mod; except if they also modify the volume of outdoors ambience.
